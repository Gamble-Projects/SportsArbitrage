# What is Sports arbitrage?

Sports arbitrage has many names but the idea is simple; place one bet per each outcome with different betting companies, the bettor can make a profit regardless of the outcome. Mathematically arbitrage occurs when there are a set of odds, which represent all mutually exclusive outcomes that cover all state space possibilities (i.e. all outcomes) of an event (source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrage_betting))
