# What is Sports arbitrage?

Betting arbitrage ("miraclebets", "surebets", sports arbitrage) is an example of arbitrage arising on betting markets due to either bookmakers' differing opinions on event outcomes or errors. When conditions allow, by placing one bet per each outcome with different betting companies, the bettor can make a profit regardless of the outcome. Mathematically arbitrage occurs when there are a set of odds, which represent all mutually exclusive outcomes that cover all state space possibilities (i.e. all outcomes) of an event, whose implied probabilities add up to less than 1.[1] In the bettors' slang an arbitrage is often referred to as an arb; people who use arbitrage are called arbers.[citation needed]
