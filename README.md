# What is Sports Arbitrage?

When betting on sports events, using arbitrage opportunities is a popular technique used to gain an edge against sportsbookmakers.  
The idea is simple; place one bet per each outcome with different betting companies, the bettor can make a profit regardless of the outcome. Mathematically arbitrage occurs when there are a set of odds, which represent all mutually exclusive outcomes that cover all state space possibilities (i.e. all outcomes) of an event ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrage_betting)).

# Who is this useful for? 

Sports-arbitrage is not for everyone. If you are never betting on sports events, this tool makes no sense for you.

# Which sites are being scraped for data?

Currently 1xbet.com and asianodds.com is being scraped for it's data as arbitrage opportunities between the two are often occuring. 

# Requirements 

Accounts (username and password) at 1xbet.com and asianodds.com. This must go into XB.py and AO.py respectively. 

# Design patterns

The tool was created before I've learned about [design patterns](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns). It's my goal to refactor the code to follow a popular design pattern.



# SOLID principles 

[SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) principles haven't been taken into consideration which will also be reworked in the near future.
